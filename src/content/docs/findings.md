title: "What We've Discovered"
description: The artifacts behind each principle, with status markers — a living research notebook that evolves as work matures.
---

LocoLab claims [five principles](the-loco-thesis). Below are the artifacts — built, measured, or in progress — that those claims rest on. Each entry has a status marker borrowed from [research](research) (where papers carry similar markers):

- `claim` — position taken, not yet built
- `architecture` — designed and specced, implementation pending
- `built` — implementation shipped, not yet measured at scale
- `measured` — empirical results, not yet published
- `published` — paper or report public

This page evolves. Items move down the status ladder as work matures. Failed claims stay on the page with their evidence — that's the point.

## Engineer before hardware

### Qwen3-30B-A3B at reading speed on a GTX 1060 6GB

- **Status:** `architecture`
- **Claim:** five `llama.cpp` flags (`--n-cpu-moe`, `--no-mmap`, `--mlock`, `--cache-type-k q4_0`, `--cache-type-v q3_0`) plus 24-64GB of system RAM let a $80 used GTX 1060 run Qwen3-30B-A3B at ~17 tokens/sec
- **Artifacts:** [LocoBench MoE-on-a-budget design spec](https://locobench.org); implementation plan; Python harness library (33+ passing tests covering config loading, server boot, llama-bench wrapper, hardware fingerprinting); 17 cell configs across 4 VRAM tiers ready to run
- **What would invalidate:** if measured `tg128` < 10 tok/s on the 1060 with the optimised preset, or if the article's claim doesn't replicate

## Specialize and harness

### LocoAgente conversational harness — Phase 1

- **Status:** `built`
- **Claim:** a routed harness around small models (four-subsystem architecture: Orchestration / Context / Tools / Inference) makes a Qwen3-4B genuinely useful as a thinking partner for tasks where frontier models converge to the average
- **Artifacts:** [LocoAgente design spec](https://locoagente.org); Phase 1 library (27 commits, 63 tests at 98% coverage on `harness.core`); E primitive `generate_variants` enforcing `n >= 2`; four orchestration patterns (`SinglePass`, `DebatePattern`, `SynthesisPattern`, `IterativeRefinement`); three Context profile bundles (business, academic, writing)
- **What would invalidate:** if a blind-test reader cannot reliably distinguish the three frames in a Perspective Debate output (frame collapse on small models)

### LocoLLM routing thesis

- **Status:** `architecture`
- **Claim:** a routed swarm of task-specific Qwen3-4B adapters outperforms a single undifferentiated Qwen3-4B on focused tasks (math, code, summarisation, etc.)
- **Artifacts:** [LocoLLM repository](https://locollm.org); QLoRA training pipeline; routing layer; partial benchmark suite
- **What would invalidate:** if the router's task-classification accuracy drops below the gain from specialisation, the system is net-negative versus the unrouted baseline

## Vary, don't average

### `FrameStrategy` deliberate variance engineering

- **Status:** `built`
- **Claim:** N variants engineered to differ (identity frames, discipline frames, constraint inversions) produce more useful divergent output than N samples hoping to differ
- **Artifacts:** four `FrameStrategy` implementations in `harness/frames.py` (`IdentityFrames`, `DisciplineFrames`, `TemperatureLadder`, `ConstraintInversion`); test suite verifying each strategy produces structurally distinct prompts; documented variance-collapse warning on `TemperatureLadder` for narrow temperature spreads
- **What would invalidate:** if the four strategies all collapse to the same output distribution on small models — i.e., engineered framing doesn't actually channel variance through the model — the principle is just an aesthetic claim

---

## Conversation, not delegation

### `Variant` + `Uncertainty` verification contract

- **Status:** `built`
- **Claim:** every harness output carries a rationale and surfaced uncertainty (load-bearing `flags` + `verification_hooks`; auxiliary `confidence`); singular outputs are forbidden at the primitive level; the human's verification loop is cheap because the harness does the prep work
- **Artifacts:** `Variant` and `Uncertainty` dataclasses in `harness/core.py`; XML tag parser enforcing required `<text>` and `<rationale>`; `CalibrationLog` recording user picks/rejects/edits as JSONL for downstream analysis
- **What would invalidate:** if users routinely ignore the `verification_hooks` field — i.e., the harness produces hooks but they're not the right hooks — the principle is performative not functional

### Keep Asking — Study 1: Does the Nudge Work?

- **Status:** `architecture`
- **Claim:** a conversational nudge shifts students from passive delegation to active conversation and improves task outcomes (using frontier models, to isolate the nudge effect from model quality)
- **Artifacts:** research design under active development; see [research](research) for the full thread (Cognitive Strategy Transfer, DSR AI Education Simulation, Keep Asking Studies 1 and 2)
- **What would invalidate:** if nudged students don't differ from un-nudged controls on either conversation patterns or outcomes

## Bridge experience, locally

### LocoPuente PoC

- **Status:** `running` (= `measured` in operational terms)
- **Claim:** a single mid-range machine (Ryzen 5 2600 + RTX 3090 24GB) running an integrated stack (primary LLM, cited search, image generation, voice, research tooling) delivers frontier-equivalent UX for everyday user tasks at zero cloud cost
- **Artifacts:** [LocoPuente service](https://locopuente.org) running on the Puente machine; browser-accessible LAN deployment; usable today by lab members and visitors
- **What would invalidate:** if users with full LocoPuente access still prefer the cloud equivalent for non-privacy-sensitive work, the bridge isn't bridging
